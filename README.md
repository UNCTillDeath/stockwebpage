# ITS-Classroom Hotline Web App

This web app is being developed for a final course project in [Comp 426-001-FA16](https://piazza.com/unc/fall2016/comp426/home).

ITS-Classroom Hotline is a team with [UNC Department of Information Technology Services](https://its.unc.edu/) that manages over 200 multipurpose classrooms in UNC's College of Arts & Sciences.

The team's website is very outdated and needs to be redone. It's currently written in ColdFusion, so it's easy to imagine how crufty both its frontend and backend are.
